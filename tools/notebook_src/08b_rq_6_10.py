# ### 8.6 RQ6. Does the pedestrian and cyclist share of injury crashes near affordable-housing sites change after completion, by borough? (M3)
#
# **Method.** RQ6, RQ8 and RQ10 ask whether the *mix* of injury crashes near a site shifts after
# completion, so they share one design. For each clean (site, cohort) unit of Section 5 we count
# injury crashes per category in the `EVENT_WINDOW` years before and after the completion year
# (the year itself is skipped). The share change at completed sites minus the change at
# not-yet-completed comparison sites of the same cohort is the gap; cohorts are averaged with the
# treated crash counts as weights, and whole clusters are resampled. A plain before/after
# comparison was rejected because the citywide victim mix moved in these years (pandemic, e-bikes).
# Shares are pooled over sites, because a share at a site with two crashes can only be 0, ½ or 1.
# Completed sites of both kinds are pooled to keep the sample usable, and each gap is repeated with
# new construction alone (preservation brings no new residents, see 11).

# **Reading.** The share changed little around completed sites and fell slightly more around
# comparison sites; the gap's interval crosses zero citywide, no borough gap survives the
# adjustment, and new construction alone gives almost the same gap. A real shift smaller than the
# interval width (a few points) would not be visible. The design allows the two groups to start at
# different levels and assumes only that they would have moved alike. The flag misses e-scooter
# riders and the clean sites are the less dense part of the programme (see 11).

# ### 8.7 RQ7. Before the project starts, are affordable-housing sites already on streets with more injury crashes than typical street locations of the same borough? (M4)
#
# **Method.** There is no street map in the two datasets, so "typical street locations" are a
# regular grid of points `REFERENCE_SPACING_M` apart, kept when any crash was reported within
# `STREET_SNAP_M` m (that drops water, parks and airports). Every grid point and every site gets the
# number of injury crashes within `BUFFER_M` m in the baseline years `BASELINE_YEARS`, and each site
# is ranked (midrank percentile) among the grid points of its borough. Only sites started after the
# baseline are used, so a new building cannot have affected its own count; the headline is new
# construction. Typical locations would average `NEUTRAL_PERCENTILE`. Sites linked within 250 m
# (the clusters of Section 5) share almost the same buffer, so whole clusters are resampled; a
# few clusters chain through whole neighbourhoods, which makes this the cautious interval.
# Alternative rejected: a cell-level correlation of units and crashes mostly measures that both are
# absent from parks. The ranking within the site's own ZIP code separates neighbourhood from street.
# This counts injury crashes; it is not a rate per traveller, so it says "more injury crashes", not
# "more dangerous", and the benchmark is street points, not other apartment buildings.

# **Reading.** New-construction sites rank well above the typical street point of their borough,

# neighbourhood and part is street: inside their own ZIP code the excess is smaller but still above
# zero. Apartment buildings stand on dense blocks near avenues and transit, where more people and

# are more dangerous per traveller. For the tenants it means the street outside already had more
# injury crashes than most of the borough before the project started. Requiring a crash within

# ### 8.9 RQ9. Across ZIP codes, is the share of deeply affordable units associated with the severity of injury crashes or with the pedestrian and cyclist share of harm? (M5)
#
# **Method.** One row per ZIP code of the Section 6 panel: the share of deeply affordable units
# (extremely and very low income) among affordable units completed by `YEAR_END`, against two
# ten-year outcomes, the pedestrian and cyclist share of injury crashes and deaths per
# `PER_THOUSAND` injury crashes. Both are ratios within injury crashes, so the 2020 reporting break
# does not enter them. ZIP codes under `MIN_ZIP_AFFORDABLE_UNITS` units are dropped (their share
# rests on one or two buildings). A raw citywide correlation would mostly compare boroughs, so
# borough means are removed before ranking (Spearman, robust to skew); the two p-values are adjusted
# together.
