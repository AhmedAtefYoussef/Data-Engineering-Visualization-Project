# ## 1. Setup
#
# Everything the notebook needs is defined in this section: the libraries, one block of named
# constants, the plotting style and a few small helpers. Nothing is imported from a project
# folder, so the notebook runs on its own next to the two data files (and downloads them from
# NYC Open Data if they are not there).

# %% [markdown]
# ### 1.1 Libraries

# ### 1.2 Constants
#
# Every threshold used later is named here once, with its unit and the reason for its value.
# Changing a value in this cell and re-running the notebook re-does the whole analysis. The years
# that depend on the study window (the break year, the base year of the index, the first test
# year, the baseline years) are computed from it here and never typed again further down.

# ### 1.3 Plot style
#
# Figures are static images, so they stay visible in any viewer (Jupyter, Colab, GitHub, a PDF
# export) without an internet connection. The role colours (housing, crash, treated, control,
# placebo) come from the Okabe-Ito palette, which remains distinguishable under the common forms
# of colour blindness. The five boroughs use a separate set so that a borough is never mistaken
# for a role.

# %%
PALETTE = {
    "housing": "#0072B2",    # blue: anything measured on the housing side
    "crash": "#D55E00",      # vermilion: anything measured on the crash side
    "treated": "#0072B2",
    "control": "#7F7F7F",
    "placebo": "#E69F00",
    "before": "#B0B0B0",
    "after": "#009E73",
    "accent": "#CC79A7",
    "neutral": "#4D4D4D",
}
# Boroughs get their own qualitative set (Paul Tol's "muted" scheme, chosen because its colours stay
# apart under the common forms of colour blindness), so none of them borrows the colour of a role
# above (blue = housing, vermilion = crash, orange = placebo). No grey is used, because grey reads as
# "no data". Borough figures also carry a label or a marker, so colour is never the only cue.
BOROUGH_COLORS = dict(zip(BOROUGHS, ["#DDCC77", "#44AA99", "#AA4499", "#88CCEE", "#332288"]))
