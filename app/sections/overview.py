"""The opening and the story: the question over a live city where every point of light is a real building, then
five chapters in which the same points regroup into what each one says.

The canvas is one stage shared by the chapters: assets/js/20-stage.js draws it and assets/js/25-story.js names an
arrangement for each chapter (its `data-layout`). Ids here start with `ov-` or `chapter-`.
