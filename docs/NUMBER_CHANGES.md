# Number changes

## Reproducible RQ7 reference points (November 2026)

Rebuilding `app/data` from the raw files on another machine moved RQ7 slightly. The cause: many crashes share
exact coordinates, so a street point often has several nearest crashes, and which one the ball tree returned (and so
the point's borough and ZIP) depended on library versions. For 18 of the 9,483 street points the tied crashes named
different boroughs. `reference_street_points` now reduces the crashes to one entry per location, carrying the borough
and ZIP recorded there most often, so the result is the same on every machine and for any order of the crash rows.
The street points themselves are unchanged (9,483); only those borough assignments moved.

| Value | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| RQ7 headline (new construction, ranked in the borough) | +19.13 (+9.38 to +22.30) | +19.14 (+9.39 to +22.31) |
| Both kinds pooled | +14.54 (+4.62 to +19.62) | +14.56 (+4.64 to +19.64) |
| New construction, ranked in its own ZIP code | +8.72 (+5.62 to +12.29) | +8.68 (+5.61 to +12.29) |
| One vote per cluster | +10.50 (+7.72 to +13.21) | +10.52 (+7.73 to +13.23) |
| `sites.parquet` `borough_percentile` | | moved by 0.02 points on average, 0.11 at most |

Every other table and every other result is identical. Two builds from scratch now produce identical tables.

## The statistics correction

Every reader-facing number that moved in the statistics correction, against commit `75c0ffd`. The tables are written by a script that compares `app/data/results.json`, `robustness.parquet`, the other parquet tables and `meta.json` from git with the rebuilt files, not by hand. `built_at`, `build_seconds` and file sizes change on every build and are left out.

## Headlines

| RQ | Before (estimate, interval) | After (estimate, interval) | Kept before | Kept after |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| RQ1 | +0.59 (+0.17 to +1.11) | +0.59 (+0.17 to +1.11) | yes | no |
| RQ2 | +0.06 (-0.07 to +0.39) | +0.06 (-0.07 to +0.39) | no | no |
| RQ3 | -4.56 (-11.90 to +3.33) | -4.56 (-11.90 to +3.33) | no | no |
| RQ4 | -2.20 (-5.78 to +1.09) | -2.20 (-5.78 to +1.09) | no | no |
| RQ5 | -8.10 (-19.58 to +4.86) | -8.10 (-19.58 to +4.86) | no | no |
| RQ6 | +1.22 (-1.08 to +3.39) | +1.22 (-1.08 to +3.39) | no | no |
| RQ7 | +19.99 (+10.39 to +23.06) | +19.13 (+9.38 to +22.30) | yes | yes |
| RQ8 | +1.38 (-2.16 to +4.29) | +1.38 (-1.93 to +4.45) | no | no |
| RQ9 | -0.202 (-0.376 to +0.012) | -0.202 (-0.376 to +0.012) | no | no |
| RQ10 | -0.83 (-2.76 to +0.67) | -0.83 (-2.54 to +0.67) | no | no |

The RQ3 estimate and interval are identical to the last digit: the published estimate is unchanged. 7 of the ten headline estimates and intervals did not move; only their wording or tags can differ.

## Why numbers moved

1. **RQ7 reference points.** Street points now qualify on crashes of the baseline years only, so no crash after the baseline decides which streets count (9,985 points to 9,483). This moves the RQ7 headline and every percentile in `sites.parquet`. The task named `baseline_tree` for this, but that tree holds injury crashes only, which would select street points on the outcome, so the snap uses a tree of all located crashes in the baseline years.
2. **RQ8 and RQ10.** RQ8 and RQ10 tables now use 5,000 resamples, because a widened interval rests on its thin tails. The 95% columns and p-values of those two tables use the same 5,000 draws, so they moved too. The printed level also changed from "99%" to 98.75% and 99.44%.
3. **RQ1 kept.** ZIP-level questions count as kept only if the interval excludes zero on both versions (Section 9.6). The estimate did not move; its tag and the words "less accurate" did.
4. **Comparison counts.** Comparison rows were shown as sites; unique sites are now exported beside rows. No estimate moved. The gate now counts unique sites. Of 108 report views scanned (each borough or all, one type or both, each size band or all; multi-select views were not scanned), 0 passed the old row count and now show the empty state.
5. **New rows and fields.** Five robustness rows, the RQ2 checks, one vote per cluster and the placebo overlap have no earlier value.

## Printed text with no change in the stored number

| Where | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| RQ8 interval level, in sentence, tag and page | 99% | 98.75% |
| RQ10 interval level, in sentence, tag and page | 99% | 99.44% |
| RQ3 event chart and notebook chart legend, comparison line | n = 1,869 | n = 696 sites |
| Event panel scope line | 1,869 comparison | 696 comparison sites (1,869 rows) |
| RQ1 tag | Clear of zero | Clear of zero on all ZIP codes only, so not counted as a finding |
| RQ7 wording | "largest effect", "far from zero" | Direction citywide, size stated as dependent on the weighting |
| Robustness text | "the data support no direction", "exceptions all switch the screen off" | Read from the rows, with the comparison cuts named and no fall claimed |

## Result sentences that changed

Before and after of each stored sentence.

| Where | What | Before | After | Why |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| results.json | questions/RQ1/sentence | The change in out-of-time forecast error from adding affordable-housing completions and stock is +0.59 injury crashes per ZIP per year (95% interval +0.17 to +1.11, n = 172 ZIP codes). The interval lies above zero, which fits a less accurate forecast. | The change in out-of-time forecast error from adding affordable-housing completions and stock is +0.59 injury crashes per ZIP per year (95% interval +0.17 to +1.11, n = 172 ZIP codes).
